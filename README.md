
FaceAI is an advanced artificial intelligence platform designed to analyze facial images for identifying and diagnosing skin conditions and diseases. The primary aim of FaceAI is to provide dermatologists with a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool, improving access to quality care for skin-related issues.

Programming Languages and Libraries:

Python
TensorFlow, Keras: Used for constructing and training AI models
NumPy, Matplotlib: Employed for data handling and visualization
scikit-learn: Utilized for producing metrics such as confusion matrices and classification reports
Key Features:

Fast and Accurate Analysis: Quickly processes images of facial skin to diagnose conditions using cutting-edge AI technology.
Advanced Classification: Employs the latest research to accurately distinguish between different skin conditions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple to use for medical professionals.
High Diagnostic Accuracy: Trains on extensive datasets to ensure reliable diagnosis.
Input/Output Specifications:

Input: A dataset of labeled facial images.
Output: Includes various metrics like model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. It also provides visualizations of model performance and sample images with their corresponding predictions and actual labels.
Script Workflow:

Model Loading: Begins with importing the CNN model with pre-trained weights that demonstrated the best validation performance.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the model using a test dataset and displays accuracy and loss results.
Predictions: Generates predictions for disease classes based on test dataset images.
True Labels: Retrieves a vector of true labels from the test dataset for analysis.
Training History Visualization: Displays graphs of training and validation accuracy and loss to track the modelâ€™s performance over time.
Confusion Matrix: Creates a visual summary of the model's performance, highlighting frequently misdiagnosed classes.
Classification Report: Generates a comprehensive report detailing precision, recall, and F1-score for each disease class.
Sample Predictions Display: Exhibits test images with both predicted and actual labels to showcase model effectiveness.
Proposed Enhancements:

Model Calibration: Integrates a calibration layer to refine softmax outputs to more accurately represent probabilities using methods like temperature scaling or isotonic regression.
Feedback Loop System: Adds a feature for dermatologists to provide feedback on the diagnoses, facilitating ongoing refinement and updates to the model. This adaptive learning approach allows the model to improve based on new data and enhances accuracy.
Implementation Details:

Confidence Calibration: After training, the model uses a portion of the validation data to fine-tune calibration parameters, adjusting outputs during inference for more accurate probabilities.
Feedback Loop: Develops an interface for medical professionals to validate or correct predictions, using this feedback to periodically update the training dataset and adjust the model through re-training or online learning.
Monitoring and Reporting: Establishes metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of recalibration and feedback mechanisms. Implements logging and reporting systems to monitor these adjustments over time and assess their impact on diagnostic accuracy.
