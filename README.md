FaceAI is an advanced artificial intelligence-based system focused on analysing facial images to detect and diagnose a variety of facial skin conditions and diseases. The aim is to provide a fast and accurate method of diagnosis, assisting dermatologists and improving the availability of quality dermatological care for facial skin problems.

Programming language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

Features: Fast and accurate processing of facial skin images to detect potential diseases. Use of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to classify identified skin conditions. Simple and user-friendly user interface, designed for ease of use by medical professionals. AI models based on the latest research, offering high accuracy in the diagnosis of skin conditions.

Input: Facial image dataset with labels

Output: Model accuracy assessment, confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy and loss visualisations and sample images with predictions

Description of script operation:

Loading the model: The script starts by loading the trained weights into the CNN model that performed best on the validation data.

Model evaluation: The model is evaluated on a test dataset. Evaluation results, including accuracy and loss, are displayed on the console.
Predictions: Based on the model, predictions are made for the images in the test set. The script assigns the most likely diagnosis class for each image.

True labels: Preparation of a vector of true labels using data from the test generator.

Visualisation of training history: Presentation of accuracy and loss graphs for training and validation data to assess the progress of model learning over time.

Confusion matrix: Generation and display of a confusion matrix, allowing a graphical representation of classification results and identification of classes that are frequently confused by the model.

Classification report: Create a classification report with precision, completeness (recall) and F1 score for each class of diagnoses.
Sample predictions: Displaying examples of test images with their true and predicted labels, giving insight into the effectiveness of the model.

Enhancement: Model Calibration and Feedback Loop Integration

To further refine FaceAI's diagnostic capabilities, an enhancement through model calibration and integration of a feedback loop is proposed. This approach aims to fine-tune the model's confidence thresholds, ensuring that its predictions not only remain accurate but also become more reliable over time.

Calibration of Prediction Confidence: Implement a calibration layer that adjusts the softmax output of the model to better reflect true probabilities. This is especially useful in medical applications where confidence in predictions must be high. Calibration can be achieved through methods such as temperature scaling or isotonic regression, which adjust the model outputs to better approximate empirical probabilities.

Feedback Loop System: Integrate a feedback mechanism where dermatologists can input the actual outcomes (i.e., correct or incorrect diagnosis) back into the system. This real-world data can be used to continually re-train and update the model, enhancing its accuracy and adaptability. Such a system promotes a dynamic learning environment where the model evolves in response to new information and challenges.

Implementation Details:

Confidence Calibration:
Integrate a calibration procedure post-training using a validation subset to determine the optimal scaling parameter.
Adjust the model's output layer during inference to reflect calibrated probabilities.
Feedback Loop:
Develop a user interface within the application that allows medical professionals to confirm or correct the predicted diagnoses.
Use these annotations to periodically update the training dataset and re-train the model, or to perform online learning if appropriate.
Monitoring and Reporting:
Establish metrics to monitor the impact of recalibration and the feedback loop on the model's performance.
Implement logging and reporting mechanisms to track model adjustments over time and their effects on diagnosis accuracy.
These enhancements not only aim to improve the diagnostic precision of FaceAI but also ensure its robustness in clinical settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and trust in AI-assisted medical diagnostics.
